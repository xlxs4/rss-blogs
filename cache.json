          "description": "As a trans-femme on HRT, I would like to know the concentrations of estradiol in my blood at all hours of day. This is useful as the peak, the trough and average all have effects. However, I only get blood tests a finite number of times per day – usually once. I am not a medical doctor, but I am the kind of doctor who can apply scientific modelling to the task of estimating curves based on limited observations. I am honestly surprised no one has done this. The intersection of trans folk and scientific computing is non-trivial. After all, the hardest problem in computer science is gender dysphoria. To do this we are going to use probabilistic programming, to get a distribution of possible level curves. This is a great use-case for probabilistic programming. We have a ton of domain knowledge, but that domain knowledge has a few parameters we don’t know, and we have only a little data. And crucially we are perfectly fine with getting a distribution of answers out, rather than a single answer.",
