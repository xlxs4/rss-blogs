          "description": "Part of the COMPUTATIONAL ABSTRACTIONS FOR PROBABILISTIC AND DIFFERENTIABLE PROGRAMMING WORKSHOP\nAbstract: Many probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) attempt to integrate with equation solvers (differential equations, nonlinear equations, partial differential equations, etc.) from the inside, i.e. the developers of the PPLs like Stan provide differential equation solver choices as part of the suite. However, as equation solvers are an entire discipline to themselves with many active development communities and subfields, this places an immense burden on PPL developers to keep up with the changing landscape of tens of thousands of independent researchers. In this talk we will explore how Julia PPLs such as Turing.jl support of equation solvers from the outside, i.e. how the tools of differentiable programming allows equation solver libraries to be compatible with PPLs  ...

          "description": "Automatic differentiation of a “solver” is a subject with many details for doing it in the most  effective form. For this reason, there are a lot of talks and courses that go into lots of depth on the topic. I recently gave a talk on some of the latest stuff in differentiable simulation with the American Statistical Association, and have some detailed notes on such adjoint derivations as part of the 18.337 Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning graduate course at MIT. And there are entire organizations like my SciML Open Source Software Organization which work day-in and day-out on the development of new differentiable solvers.\nI’ll give a brief summary of all my materials here below.\nContinuous vs Discrete Differentiation of Solvers\nAD of a solver can be done in essentially two different ways: either directly performing automatic  ...

In this talk we will start by showcasing some of the ways that SciML is being used, from discovery of extrapolatory epidemic models to nonlinear mixed effects models in pharmacology. From there, we will discuss some of the increasingly advanced computational techniques behind the training process, focusing on the numerical issues involved in handling differentiation of highly stiff and chaotic systems.

The second and final major update with an official modding API is still coming. I don't have a release date for that yet, so I hope you remain patient!\nIn the meantime, my paper for the European Lisp Symposium in Amsterdam was accepted, so I will be presenting Kandria there.

The Julia language originated in academia and focused heavily on helping scientists write better code, which is going great and deserves much praise! However, to onboard more software engineers and professional organizations we're going to have to invest even further into code quality and automated code quality tools and other methods such as used in the field of \"quality assurance\". In this article I'll explore the current state in the Julia ecosystem.\nAt our workplace we have investigated the following tools and practices. I'll start from generic practices and then move on to more advanced tools.\nPackage structure\nUnit testing with Pkg.jl\nAutomated testing and Continuous Integration (C…",

When working with the Julia language, one visualization I enjoy is seeing the type space of a method that you are dispatching on. Normally I do this in my mind's eye, but let me clarify this by drawing some actual figures.\nTo start with the basics; Julia has functions and methods. A function is simply the name, like push! or read . Methods are specific definitions of a function, for certain types of arguments. Take for example push!(s::Set, x) or read(io::IO) . From an object-oriented perspective you could say that methods are instances of functions.\n\nFor any given method you can consider the dispatching as slicing a part of the entire possible type space of that gi…",

However, there is a somewhat major update coming out next week!\nYou may have guessed from the title, but we're adding Japanese localisation to the game! It'll release on Wednesday, 12th of April. As someone that's been trying to learn Japanese for a long time, this is another step in the development that I've been looking forward to very much.\n\nI'm also really glad that we can release this already, so it'll be well out by the time I visit Tokyo Game Show in September!\nOther news\nWith the level editor and the beginning of the modding support already in place, I've taken a bit of a step back from Kandria development for a bit, and instead focused on working on a lot of other stuff that's been way overdue, like moving and upgrading our servers, taking care of my mental health, and starting work on pre-pre-production for the next game.\nHowever, Kandria development is not yet done. The second and final major update with an official modding API is still coming. I don't have a release date for that yet, so I hope you remain patient!\nIn the meantime, my paper for the European Lisp Symposium in Amsterdam was accepted, so I will be presenting Kandria there. The paper is quite technical, but if you're interested in Common Lisp, it might be worth a read. And if you're going to be in Amsterdam, let me know. I'd be happy to chat!\nThat's it for now\nA rather short update this month, but if you're interested in the details of the pre-pre-production process, come on hang out in the Shirakumo channel with the rest of us!
