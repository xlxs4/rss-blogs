We looked at this problem in detail in our new manuscript titled Capturing missing physics in climate model parameterizations using neural differential equations.\nThe goal of this project is to understand temperature mixing in large eddy simulations, essentially columns of water in the ocean. I.e., can we take a “true” 3D Navier-Stokes and use that to build very quick and accurate models for how heat flows up and down in the water?\n\nThis isn’t a new problem: climate scientists  ...
