We thought it would be interesting to see what the performance differences were, both for this function and a more useful variant which searches a tree rather than flattening it.
What we measured
The code we used is here1. We measured four variations of each of two functions.
List flattening
All these functions use collecting to build their results forwards. They live in flatten-variants.lisp.
flatten/implicit-stack works in the obvious recursive way, with an implicit stack. This uses iterate to express the local recursive function.
flatten/explicit-stack uses an explicit stack (called agenda in the code) repr…</span>

                              <span>Very often people regard the stack as a scarce, expensive resource, while the heap is plentiful and very cheap. This is absurd: the stack is memory, the heap is also memory. Deforming programs so they are ‘iterative’ in order that they do not run out of the stack we imagine to be so costly is ridiculous: if you have a program which is inherently recursive, let it be recursive.
In a previous article my friend Zyni wrote some variations on a list-flattening function1, some of which were ‘recursive’ and some of which ‘iterative’. Of course, the ones which claim to be iterative are, in fact, recursive: any procedure which traverses a recursively-defined data structure such as a tree of conses is necessarily recursive. The ‘iterative’ versions just use an explicitly-maintained stack rather than…</span>

Today I&#x27;d like to share the good news that WebAssembly is finally coming
for the rest of us weirdos.
This is a transcript-alike of a talk that I gave last week at , a gathering in Berlin of
people that are using &quot;technologies beyond the mainstream&quot; to get things
done: Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, and so on.  PDF slides , and I&#x27;ll link the video too when it becomes available.BOB

WebAssembly: what even is it?  Not a programming language that
you would write software in, but rather a compilation target: a sort of
assembly language, if you will.
If you look at what the characteristics of WebAssembly are as an
abstract machine, to me there are two main areas in which it is an
advance over the alternatives.
Firstly it&#x27;s &quot;close to the metal&quot; -- if you compile for example…</span>

to get a fair estimate of the size of a project, and it groups line counts by
file type to help see immediately which languages are used.
A long time ago I got frustrated with two well known line counters.
Sloccount spits out multiple strange Perl
warnings about locales, and most of the output is a copyright notice and some
absurd cost estimations. Cloc has fourteen
Perl packages as dependencies. Writing a simple line counter is an interesting
exercise; at the time I was discovering Common Lisp, so I wrote my own
version.
I made a few changes years after years, but most of the code stayed the same.
I thought it would be interesting to revisit this program and present it part

First of all we all know that CL does not promise to optimize tail recursion: means that tail recursive program may generate recursive not iterative process. So recursive program in CL even if tail recursive is not safe on data of unknown size, assuming stack is limited.
But let us assume as good implementations do that tail recursion is optimized in implementation (no need for general tail calls here but is obvious nice th…</span>

next couple months and wanted to release it into the wild.  They say if
you love your ideas, you should let them go and see if they come back to
you, right?  In that spirit I abandon this idea to the woods.
Basically the idea is , but for modules
that store their data on the GC-managed heap instead of just in linear
memory.Wizer-like pre-initialization of WebAssembly
modules
Say you have a WebAssembly module with .
It might look like this:GC
types
You define some struct and array types, there are some global variables,
and some functions to actually do the work.  (There are probably also
tables and other things but I am simplifying.)
If you consider the object graph of an instantiated module, you will

                              <span>Hello,
It has been a long time since I posted something here.  I have been busy with my day job and bogged down in a major rewrite of something (more on this hopefully very soon now (tm)) that is full of rabbit&#x27;s holes.
I was able to get out of one of these rabbit&#x27;s holes with this little hack I cooked up that allows you to, possibly, write more concise code.
This little hack introduces two handy Common Lisp
macros, LETV and LETV* that allow you to mix
regular LET and MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND forms in
a less verbose way.  The amount of indentation needed is also reduced.
 

The syntax of LETV (or LETV*) is very
&quot;loopy&quot;, with a nod to SML/OCaml/F#/Haskell/Julia.  The current syntax
  is the following:
    letv     ::&#x3D; &#x27;LETV&#x27; [vars] [IN [body]]
    letvstar ::&#x3D; &#x27;LETV*&#x27; [vars] [IN [body]]

    var…</span>

Level Editor
The level editor received a big overhaul and is now a lot more accessible. There&#x27;s also official documentation now to help get you started and explain all the tools and shortcuts available. If you want to dig in, just update your game and navigate to Mod Manager &gt; Create Mod, which should place you directly into the editor in a new world of your own!
Sharing Mods
You can play levels made by others and download them directly from within the game. To browse existing levels, simply go to Mod Manager &gt; Discover. From there you can select and install mods. Once installed, you can play their world under the Worlds tab.

Level Editing
The biggest part of the update is, no doubt, the polished level editor. The editor has always been a part of Kandria since release, but now it&#x27;s nicely polished and much easier to use!

I&#x27;ve also included documentation to make it much easier for you to get a handle on how the editor works and how to get started with using it. I&#x27;m very excited to see what people can come up with!
And yes, the entire Kandria world was created in this editor, so it is fully capable of creating some very complex levels!

                              <span>Everyone who has written Lisp has written tiny Lisp evaluators in Lisp: here are two more.
Following two recent articles I wrote on scope and extent in Common Lisp, I thought I would finish with two very tiny evaluators for dynamically and lexically bound variants on a tiny Lisp.
The language
The tiny Lisp these evaluators interpret is not minimal: it has constructs other than lambda, and even has assignment. But it is pretty small. Other than the binding rules the languages are identical.
λ &amp; lambda are synonyms and construct procedures, which can take any number of arguments;
quote quotes its argument;
if is conditional expression (the else part is optional);
set! is assignment and mutates a binding.


That is all that exists.

                              <span>In Common Lisp, dynamic bindings and lexical bindings live in the same namespace. They don’t have to.
Common Lisp has two sorts of bindings for variables: lexical binding and dynamic binding. Lexical binding has lexical scope — the binding is available where it is visible in source code — and indefinite extent — the binding is available as long as any code might reference it. Dynamic binding has indefinite scope — the binding is available to any code which runs between when the binding is established and when control leaves the form which established it — and dynamic extent — the binding ceases to exist when control leaves the binding form.
These are really two very different things. However CL places both of these kinds of bindings into the same namespace, relying on special declarations …</span>

Lock
is the builtin Emacs minor mode used to highlight textual elements in buffers.
Major modes usually configure it to detect various syntaxic constructions and
attach
faces
to them.
The reason I ended up deep into Font Lock is because I was not satisfied with
the way it is configured for lisp-mode, the major mode used for both Common
Lisp and Emacs Lisp code. This forced me to get acquainted with various
aspects of Font Lock in order to change its configuration. If you want to
change highlighting for your favourite major mode, you will find this article

Common Lisp highlighting done wrong
The core issue of Common Lisp highlighting in Emacs is that a lot of it is

By Internet standards this is shockingly expensive. Though it’s touted as the future of the search engine, any company scaling the technology up to the world’s 10 billion or so daily queries will face suffocating costs. The milestone for Artificial Intelligence may be that it’s now about as expensive as the real thing: Amazon’s mechanical turk service (which Jeff Bezos called “artificial artificial intelligence”) also pays its human labourers a few cents per question-response task.</span>

can have a look instead to the .at the FOSDEM event

So the context for the whole effort is that Guile has this part of its
implementation which is in C.  It also exposes a lot of that
implementation to users as an API.
So what contraints does this kind of API impose on the garbage
collector?
Let&#x27;s start by considering the simple  call above.  In a
garbage-collected environment, the GC is responsible for reclaiming
unused memory.  How does the GC know that the result of a 
call is in use?consscm_cons

for garbage-collected heaps.  There are a few possible answers,
depending on what your goals are for the system.
Sometimes you build a system and you want to study it: to identify its
principal components and see how they work together, or to isolate the
effect of altering a single component.  In that case, what you want is a
fixed heap size.  You run your program a few times and determine a heap
size that is sufficient for your problem, and then in future run the
program with that new fixed heap size.  This allows you to concentrate
on the other components of the system.
A good approach to choosing the fixed heap size for a program is to
determine the minimum heap size a program can have by bisection, then
multiplying …</span>

implementing ephemerons in a garbage
collector
In our  we
looked at a serial algorithm to trace ephemerons.  However, production
garbage collectors are parallel: during collection, they trace
the object graph using multiple worker threads.  Our problem is to
extend the ephemeron-tracing algorithm with support for multiple tracing
threads, without introducing stalls or serial bottlenecks.last

Recall that we ended up having to define a table of pending ephemerons:
This table holds  ephemerons that have been visited by the
graph tracer but whose keys haven&#x27;t been found yet, as well as a
singly-linked list of  ephemerons that are waiting to have
their values traced.  As a global data structure, the pending ephemeron…</span>

                              <span>Good evening, patient hackers :)  Today finishes off my .series on
implementing ephemerons in a garbage
collector
Last time, we had a working solution for ephemerons, but it involved
recursively visiting any pending ephemerons from within the 
routine—the bit of a semi-space collector that is called when
traversing the object graph and we see an object that we hadn&#x27;t seen
yet.  This recursive visit could itself recurse, and so we could
overflow the control stack.copy
The solution, of course, is &quot;don&#x27;t do that&quot;: instead of visiting
recursively, enqueue the ephemeron for visiting later.  Iterate, don&#x27;t
recurse.  But here we run into a funny problem: how do we add an
ephemeron to a queue or worklist?  It&#x27;s such a pedestrian question
(&quot;just... enqueue it?&quot;) but I think it illustrates some of t…</span>

collector with support for ephemerons.  Spoiler alert: we fail in a
subtle and interesting way.  See if you can spot it before the end :)
Recall that, as we concluded in ,
a memory manager needs to incorporate ephemerons as a core part of the
tracing algorithm.  Ephemerons are not macro-expressible in terms of
object trace functions.an earlier
article
Instead, to support ephemerons we need to augment our core trace
routine.  When we see an ephemeron , we need to check if the key 
is already visited (and therefore live); if so, we trace the value 
directly, and we&#x27;re done.  Otherwise, we add  to a global table of
pending ephemerons , indexed under .  Finally whenever we trace a
new object , ephemerons included, we look up  in …</span>

just need it to also do X&quot;.  Perhaps you are able to build X directly
out of what the algorithm gives you; fantastic.  Or, perhaps you can
alter the algorithm a bit, and it works just as well while also doing X.
Sometimes, though, you alter the algorithm and things go pear-shaped.

Many of you know what these are, but perhaps not so many have
seen an annotated implementation, so let&#x27;s do that.
Just to recap, the big picture here is that a semi-space collector
divides a chunk of memory into two equal halves or spaces, called the
 and the .  Allocation proceeds linearly across
tospace, from one end to the other.  When the tospace is full, we 
the spaces: the tospace becomes the fromspace, and the fromspace becomes
the tospace.  The collector copies out all live data  the
fromspace  the tospace (hence the names), starting from some set of
root objects.  Once the copy is done, allocation then proceeds in the
new tospace.fromspacetospaceflipfromto

For context, one of the goals of the  is to replace

garbage collector for a production language runtime is risky, and for Guile one of the mitigation
strategies for this work is that the new collector is behind an abstract API
whose implementation can be chosen at compile-time, without requiring
changes to user code.  That way we can first switch to
BDW-implementing-the-new-GC-API, then switch the implementation behind
that API to something else.GC implementation I have been

Abstract: Many probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) attempt to integrate with equation solvers (differential equations, nonlinear equations, partial differential equations, etc.) from the inside, i.e. the developers of the PPLs like Stan provide differential equation solver choices as part of the suite. However, as equation solvers are an entire discipline to themselves with many active development communities and subfields, this places an immense burden on PPL developers to keep up with the changing landscape of tens of thousands of independent researchers. In this talk we will explore how Julia PPLs such as Turing.jl support of equation solvers from the outside, i.e. how the tools of differentiable programming allows equation solver libraries to be compatible with PPLs  ...

                              <span>Physically, this book is obnoxious: huge, wasted margins frame a reproduction
of the original text that painstakingly tries to look as shabby as it was,
including faded letters and all its typos, and its size and weight border on
the unmanageable.  Ah, but the contents is really good: on the one hand
there&#x27;s of course Joyce&#x27;s text itself (after twenty years since the last time,
my English, with the help of the annotations, was closer to be up to the task,
and enjoy it even when it wasn&#x27;t), and next to it the essays introducing every
chapter, which i found (with an exception or two) very informative and,
sometimes, even illuminating.  I was also delighted to confirm that the
parallels with Homer&#x27;s work are a strecht to say the least: i quickly read The
Odyssey in preparation and found it, again, boring at best and disheartening
in its depiction of the society of the time (not that Joyce&#x27;s Dublin was
without its blemishes, but you hopefully get my point).



So, just get an electronic version and enjoy!

                              <span>This is a beautiful book.  Crystal-clear and insightful explanations, with the
right amount of historical background and quite original outlook (without
going overboard).  I can only echo what other quoted reviewers have said: i
wish i had had this book when i was studying these matters in earnest, i&#x27;m
pretty sure i&#x27;ve understood some fine points for the first time only now!  I&#x27;d
also perhaps make an exception on the last part (or act, as Needham calls
them) on differential forms, which feels at times a bit rushed and in need of
some editing, and it&#x27;d had been wonderful if the manufacture of the book were
up to its contents: most images and photographs look really, really cheap, and
there are more typos than granted, which is a pity (as to other figures,
they&#x27;re decent, although it must be said that Needham is not Penrose, but then
who is?).

                              <span>Automatic differentiation of a “solver” is a subject with many details for doing it in the most  effective form. For this reason, there are a lot of talks and courses that go into lots of depth on the topic. I recently gave a talk on some of the latest stuff in differentiable simulation with the American Statistical Association, and have some detailed notes on such adjoint derivations as part of the 18.337 Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning graduate course at MIT. And there are entire organizations like my SciML Open Source Software Organization which work day-in and day-out on the development of new differentiable solvers.
I’ll give a brief summary of all my materials here below.

                              <span>Is differentiable programming actually necessary, or can you just train the neural network in isolation against data and then stick the trained neural network into the simulation? We looked at this problem in detail in our new manuscript titled Capturing missing physics in climate model parameterizations using neural differential equations.
The goal of this project is to understand temperature mixing in large eddy simulations, essentially columns of water in the ocean. I.e., can we take a “true” 3D Navier-Stokes and use that to build very quick and accurate models for how heat flows up and down in the water?

This isn’t a new problem: climate scientists  ... READ MORE

                              <span>A very interesting view of how a biographer started her career in the
seventies, with two heavy-weights, Beckett and de Beauvoir.  Bair calls the
book a bio-memoir, and it&#x27;s indeed quite deserving of a name of its own for
its genre.  One learns of the struggle it was not only to be a biographer of
famous writers still living (and her fascinating relationship with them) but
also to be a successful woman in the seventies.  And there are lots of
interesting details about her writing process, and its all too human side.
Very well written all around, it really whets your appetite: i&#x27;ve already
ordered her Beckett bio!

local data, including org and text notes, documents in PDF or similar formats,
HTML files, and local email. As a result, my little consult-recoll package has
gone up a few notches up in my list.  i&#x27;ve just released version 0.5,
featuring live previews.












Recoll is a local search engine that knows how to index a wide variety of file
formats.  It also offers a sophisticated query language, and, for some
document kinds, snippets of the text of the document that actually match your
query: that&#x27;s always been one of my favourite features, and wanted to bring it
to emacs.



i found consult&#x27;s live previews a very nice venue to bring snippets into

                              <span>Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) methods allow for the automatic discovery of mechanistic models by infusing neural network training into the simulation process. In this talk we will start by showcasing some of the ways that SciML is being used, from discovery of extrapolatory epidemic models to nonlinear mixed effects models in pharmacology. From there, we will discuss some of the increasingly advanced computational techniques behind the training process, focusing on the numerical issues involved in handling differentiation of highly stiff and chaotic systems. The viewers will leave with an understanding of how compiler techniques are being infused into the simulation stack to increasingly automate the process of developing mechanistic models

Presenters: Viral Shah (Julia Computing, CEO and Co-Founder), Chris Rackauckas (Julia Computing, Director of Modeling and Simulation and Christopher Laughman (Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Principal Member Research Staff)
Abstract: As modeling has become more ubiquitous, our models keep growing. The time to build models, verify their behavior, and simulate them is increasing exponentially as we seek more precise predictions. How will our tools change to accommodate the future? Julia’s language design has led to new opportunities. The combination of multiple dispatch, staged compilation, and Julia’s composable libraries have made it possible to build a next generation symbolic-numeric framework. Julia’s abstract interpretation framework enables capabilities such as automatic differentiation, automatic surrogate generation, symbolic tracing, uncertainty propagation, and automatic  ...

                              <span>A nicely written (as always with Ishiguro) history of Stevens turned into an
artificially intelligent being, in a near future reminiscent of Never let me
go.  In other words, i found this novel heavily inspired in previous works of
the author, which i admittedly find better than this one, but that doesn&#x27;t
mean the book doesn&#x27;t throw at you a bunch of provocative musings or lacks a
tranquil beauty that makes it absolutely worth reading.

elegant note-taking system with a stress on simplicity and, as the author puts
it, low-tech requirements.  Now, those are excellent qualities in my book, and
i think i&#x27;d quickly become a denote user if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that i
already have a homegrown set of utilities following a similar philosophy.
Inevitably, they differ in some details, as is to be expected from software
that has grown with me, as Prot&#x27;s with him, during more than a decade, but
they are similar in important ways.



I&#x27;ve had in mind writing a brief note on my notes utilities for a while, so i
guess this is a good time for it: i can, after showing you mine, point you to

minor friction with its interface quickly becomes an irritant, and i
thus find myself needed a truly smooth emacs-human interaction; or, to
be more precise emacs-jao interaction: my must needs are going to be,
sometimes, triffles to you, and the other way round.



During the last year, a perceived sluggishness in Emacs&#x27;s X11 display
performance, together with a very noticeably increased RAM consumption
have become one of those irritants, and i decided that enough is
enough, and moved (for the time being at least) from exwm to,
essentially, using xmonad and kitty as my Emacs&#x27;s display engine.
