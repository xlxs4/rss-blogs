                              <span>How much memory should a program get?  Tonight, a quick note on sizing
for garbage-collected heaps.  There are a few possible answers,
depending on what your goals are for the system.
Sometimes you build a system and you want to study it: to identify its
principal components and see how they work together, or to isolate the
effect of altering a single component.  In that case, what you want is a
fixed heap size.  You run your program a few times and determine a heap
size that is sufficient for your problem, and then in future run the
program with that new fixed heap size.  This allows you to concentrate
on the other components of the system.
A good approach to choosing the fixed heap size for a program is to
determine the minimum heap size a program can have by bisection, then
multiplying …</span>

In our  we
looked at a serial algorithm to trace ephemerons.  However, production
garbage collectors are parallel: during collection, they trace
the object graph using multiple worker threads.  Our problem is to
extend the ephemeron-tracing algorithm with support for multiple tracing
threads, without introducing stalls or serial bottlenecks.last

Recall that we ended up having to define a table of pending ephemerons:
This table holds  ephemerons that have been visited by the
graph tracer but whose keys haven&#x27;t been found yet, as well as a
singly-linked list of  ephemerons that are waiting to have
their values traced.  As a global data structure, the pending ephemeron…</span>

                              <span>Good evening, patient hackers :)  Today finishes off my .series on
implementing ephemerons in a garbage
collector
Last time, we had a working solution for ephemerons, but it involved
recursively visiting any pending ephemerons from within the 
routine—the bit of a semi-space collector that is called when
traversing the object graph and we see an object that we hadn&#x27;t seen
yet.  This recursive visit could itself recurse, and so we could
overflow the control stack.copy
The solution, of course, is &quot;don&#x27;t do that&quot;: instead of visiting
recursively, enqueue the ephemeron for visiting later.  Iterate, don&#x27;t
recurse.  But here we run into a funny problem: how do we add an
ephemeron to a queue or worklist?  It&#x27;s such a pedestrian question
(&quot;just... enqueue it?&quot;) but I think it illustrates some of t…</span>

collector with support for ephemerons.  Spoiler alert: we fail in a
subtle and interesting way.  See if you can spot it before the end :)
Recall that, as we concluded in ,
a memory manager needs to incorporate ephemerons as a core part of the
tracing algorithm.  Ephemerons are not macro-expressible in terms of
object trace functions.an earlier
article
Instead, to support ephemerons we need to augment our core trace
routine.  When we see an ephemeron , we need to check if the key 
is already visited (and therefore live); if so, we trace the value 
directly, and we&#x27;re done.  Otherwise, we add  to a global table of
pending ephemerons , indexed under .  Finally whenever we trace a
new object , ephemerons included, we look up  in …</span>

                              <span>Good day, hackfolk.  Today&#x27;s article is about semi-space collectors.
Many of you know what these are, but perhaps not so many have
seen an annotated implementation, so let&#x27;s do that.
Just to recap, the big picture here is that a semi-space collector
divides a chunk of memory into two equal halves or spaces, called the
 and the .  Allocation proceeds linearly across
tospace, from one end to the other.  When the tospace is full, we 
the spaces: the tospace becomes the fromspace, and the fromspace becomes
the tospace.  The collector copies out all live data  the
fromspace  the tospace (hence the names), starting from some set of
root objects.  Once the copy is done, allocation then proceeds in the
new tospace.fromspacetospaceflipfromto

garbage collector for a production language runtime is risky, and for Guile one of the mitigation
strategies for this work is that the new collector is behind an abstract API
whose implementation can be chosen at compile-time, without requiring
changes to user code.  That way we can first switch to
BDW-implementing-the-new-GC-API, then switch the implementation behind

Abstract: Many probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) attempt to integrate with equation solvers (differential equations, nonlinear equations, partial differential equations, etc.) from the inside, i.e. the developers of the PPLs like Stan provide differential equation solver choices as part of the suite. However, as equation solvers are an entire discipline to themselves with many active development communities and subfields, this places an immense burden on PPL developers to keep up with the changing landscape of tens of thousands of independent researchers. In this talk we will explore how Julia PPLs such as Turing.jl support of equation solvers from the outside, i.e. how the tools of differentiable programming allows equation solver libraries to be compatible with PPLs  ...

First described in a , which
attributes the invention to George Bosworth, ephemerons are a kind of
weak key-value association.1997 paper by Barry
Hayes
Thinking about the problem abstractly, consider that the garbage
collector&#x27;s job is to keep live objects and recycle memory for dead
objects, making that memory available for future allocations.  Formally
speaking, we can say:
This circular definition uses the word , indicating a disjunction:
a single incoming reference from a live object is sufficient to mark a
referent object as live.any
Ephemerons augment this definition with a conjunction:

                              <span>Physically, this book is obnoxious: huge, wasted margins frame a reproduction
of the original text that painstakingly tries to look as shabby as it was,
including faded letters and all its typos, and its size and weight border on
the unmanageable.  Ah, but the contents is really good: on the one hand
there&#x27;s of course Joyce&#x27;s text itself (after twenty years since the last time,
my English, with the help of the annotations, was closer to be up to the task,
and enjoy it even when it wasn&#x27;t), and next to it the essays introducing every
chapter, which i found (with an exception or two) very informative and,
sometimes, even illuminating.  I was also delighted to confirm that the
parallels with Homer&#x27;s work are a strecht to say the least: i quickly read The
Odyssey in preparation and found it, again, boring at best and disheartening
in its depiction of the society of the time (not that Joyce&#x27;s Dublin was
without its blemishes, but you hopefully get my point).



So, just get an electronic version and enjoy!

right amount of historical background and quite original outlook (without
going overboard).  I can only echo what other quoted reviewers have said: i
wish i had had this book when i was studying these matters in earnest, i&#x27;m
pretty sure i&#x27;ve understood some fine points for the first time only now!  I&#x27;d
also perhaps make an exception on the last part (or act, as Needham calls
them) on differential forms, which feels at times a bit rushed and in need of
some editing, and it&#x27;d had been wonderful if the manufacture of the book were
up to its contents: most images and photographs look really, really cheap, and
there are more typos than granted, which is a pity (as to other figures,
they&#x27;re decent, although it must be said that Needham is not Penrose, but then
who is?).

A funny post today; I gave an internal presentation at work recently
describing the so-called &quot;sticky mark bit&quot; algorithm.  I figured I might
as well post it here, as a gift to you from your local garbage human.
Before diving in though, we start with some broad context about

collection&quot; these days, but really it describes a component of a system
that provides fresh memory for new objects and  reclaims memory for objects that won&#x27;t be needed in the program&#x27;s future.  This stands in
contrast to , which relies on the programmer

Of course, automatic memory management ensures some valuable system-wide
properties, like lack of .  But also by

                              <span>Automatic differentiation of a “solver” is a subject with many details for doing it in the most  effective form. For this reason, there are a lot of talks and courses that go into lots of depth on the topic. I recently gave a talk on some of the latest stuff in differentiable simulation with the American Statistical Association, and have some detailed notes on such adjoint derivations as part of the 18.337 Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning graduate course at MIT. And there are entire organizations like my SciML Open Source Software Organization which work day-in and day-out on the development of new differentiable solvers.
I’ll give a brief summary of all my materials here below.

                              <span>Hello all, a quick post today.  Inspired by  by Yi Lin et al, a few months ago I had a look to see how the basic Rust concurrency facilities that they used were implemented.Rust as a Language for High Performance GC Implementation
One of the key components that Lin et al used was a Chase-Lev work-stealing double-ended queue (deque).  The 2005 article  by David Chase and Yossi Lev is a nice read defining this data structure.  It&#x27;s used when you have a single producer of values, but multiple threads competing to claim those values.  This is useful when implementing per-CPU schedulers or work queues; each CPU pushes on any items that it has to its own deque, and pops them also, but when it runs out of work, it goes to see if it can steal work from other CPUs.Dynamic Circular Work-Stealing Deq…</span>

                              <span>A very interesting view of how a biographer started her career in the
seventies, with two heavy-weights, Beckett and de Beauvoir.  Bair calls the
book a bio-memoir, and it&#x27;s indeed quite deserving of a name of its own for
its genre.  One learns of the struggle it was not only to be a biographer of
famous writers still living (and her fascinating relationship with them) but
also to be a successful woman in the seventies.  And there are lots of
interesting details about her writing process, and its all too human side.
Very well written all around, it really whets your appetite: i&#x27;ve already
ordered her Beckett bio!

local data, including org and text notes, documents in PDF or similar formats,
HTML files, and local email. As a result, my little consult-recoll package has
gone up a few notches up in my list.  i&#x27;ve just released version 0.5,
featuring live previews.












Recoll is a local search engine that knows how to index a wide variety of file
formats.  It also offers a sophisticated query language, and, for some
document kinds, snippets of the text of the document that actually match your
query: that&#x27;s always been one of my favourite features, and wanted to bring it
to emacs.



i found consult&#x27;s live previews a very nice venue to bring snippets into

                              <span>Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) methods allow for the automatic discovery of mechanistic models by infusing neural network training into the simulation process. In this talk we will start by showcasing some of the ways that SciML is being used, from discovery of extrapolatory epidemic models to nonlinear mixed effects models in pharmacology. From there, we will discuss some of the increasingly advanced computational techniques behind the training process, focusing on the numerical issues involved in handling differentiation of highly stiff and chaotic systems. The viewers will leave with an understanding of how compiler techniques are being infused into the simulation stack to increasingly automate the process of developing mechanistic models

Presenters: Viral Shah (Julia Computing, CEO and Co-Founder), Chris Rackauckas (Julia Computing, Director of Modeling and Simulation and Christopher Laughman (Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Principal Member Research Staff)
Abstract: As modeling has become more ubiquitous, our models keep growing. The time to build models, verify their behavior, and simulate them is increasing exponentially as we seek more precise predictions. How will our tools change to accommodate the future? Julia’s language design has led to new opportunities. The combination of multiple dispatch, staged compilation, and Julia’s composable libraries have made it possible to build a next generation symbolic-numeric framework. Julia’s abstract interpretation framework enables capabilities such as automatic differentiation, automatic surrogate generation, symbolic tracing, uncertainty propagation, and automatic  ...

                              <span>A nicely written (as always with Ishiguro) history of Stevens turned into an
artificially intelligent being, in a near future reminiscent of Never let me
go.  In other words, i found this novel heavily inspired in previous works of
the author, which i admittedly find better than this one, but that doesn&#x27;t
mean the book doesn&#x27;t throw at you a bunch of provocative musings or lacks a
tranquil beauty that makes it absolutely worth reading.

elegant note-taking system with a stress on simplicity and, as the author puts
it, low-tech requirements.  Now, those are excellent qualities in my book, and
i think i&#x27;d quickly become a denote user if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that i
already have a homegrown set of utilities following a similar philosophy.
Inevitably, they differ in some details, as is to be expected from software
that has grown with me, as Prot&#x27;s with him, during more than a decade, but
they are similar in important ways.



I&#x27;ve had in mind writing a brief note on my notes utilities for a while, so i
guess this is a good time for it: i can, after showing you mine, point you to

minor friction with its interface quickly becomes an irritant, and i
thus find myself needed a truly smooth emacs-human interaction; or, to
be more precise emacs-jao interaction: my must needs are going to be,
sometimes, triffles to you, and the other way round.



During the last year, a perceived sluggishness in Emacs&#x27;s X11 display
performance, together with a very noticeably increased RAM consumption
have become one of those irritants, and i decided that enough is
enough, and moved (for the time being at least) from exwm to,
essentially, using xmonad and kitty as my Emacs&#x27;s display engine.

                              <span>If you can read Spanish, i wouldn&#x27;t miss the opportunity to read this
beautfiul essay in the original: Irene Vallejo&#x27;s prose is clear,
elegant and very beautiful.  It&#x27;s a delight (and a relief) to read.
And, if you can&#x27;t read Spanish but have a translation handy, i
wouldn&#x27;t miss the opportunity to read it either, for a very
entertaining account of the history of ancient books sprinkled with
lots of interesting (to me, at least!) bits about the Greek and Roman
worlds.  The book is morever wrapped in a subdued and sober optimism
that i&#x27;ve found reinvigorating and sorely needed in these times, when
one often feels like running on empty.  Heartily recommended!
