                              <span>Yesterday I wrote an article describing one of the ways traditional Lisp macros can be unhygienic even when they appear to be hygienic. Here’s a horrible solution to that.
The problem I described is that the expansion of a macro can refer to the values (usually the function values) of names, which the user of the macro can bind, causing the macro to fail. So, given a function
(defun call-with-foo (thunk)
  ...
  (funcall thunk))
Then the macro layer on top of it
(defmacro with-foo (&amp;body forms)
  &#x60;(call-with-foo (lambda () ,@forms)))
is not hygienic so long as local functions named call-with-foo are allowed:
(flet ((call-with-foo (...) ...))
  (with-foo ...))
The sensible solution to this is to say, just as the standard does about symbols in the CL package that you are not allowed to do that.
Here’s another solution:
(defmacro with-foo (&amp;body forms)
  &#x60;(funcall (symbol-function &#x27;call-with-foo) (lambda () ,@forms)))
This is robust against anything short of top-level redefinition of call-with-foo. And you can be mostly robust even against that:
(defmacro with-foo (&amp;body forms)
  &#x60;(funcall (load-time-value (symbol-function &#x27;call-with-foo))
            (lambda () ,@forms)))
This still isn’t safe against really malignant users, since the load time of the macro’s definition and its uses are not the same. But it’s probably fairly good.
I hope I never feel I have to use techniques like this.</span>

This post is a collaboration with Keith Myerscough, a mathematical consultant and senior engineer, who helped me with setting up our internal Julia language ecosystem.
Matthijs asked me to write a guest post about what skills are needed to become a great scientific coder. He asked me because I assisted a team of scientists in adopting Julia for their research and development work. I am keen to help: I empathize with people who come up with great ideas but have a hard time wrapping these up into something that can be turned into a product.

Hygienic macros
I do not fully understand all the problems which Scheme-style hygienic macros try to solve, and the implementation of the solutions is usually sufficiently difficult to understand that I have always been put off doing so, especially as the details of the implementation in Racket, the Scheme-related language I use most, seems to change every few years. I’m happy enough that I am mostly competent to write the macros I need in Racket, without understanding the details of the implementation.
Traditional Lisp macros are, to me, far more appealing because they work in such an explicit and simp…</span>

Many people have tried to answer what is so special about Lisp by talking about many things.
Such as interactive development, a thing common now to many languages of course, and if you use Racket with DrRacket not in fact how development usually works there at all. Are we to cast Racket into the outer darkness?1
Such as CLOS, a thing specific to Common Lisp: can you not achieve Lisp enlightenment unless you program in Common Lisp? Was Lisp enlightmenent impossible before CLOS existed? What stupid ideas. Could you implement CLOS in a language which was not Lisp? Certainly you could.

To a first approximation, Ark—or rather, what I am calling Ark; I don&#x27;t

novelty in relation to the familiar, and today&#x27;s note is a departure: we

not on JavaScript but on the  language.old-timeFlutterDart
Where to start, even?  The problem is big enough that I&#x27;ll
approach it from three different angles: from the past, from the top,
and from the bottom.
With the other frameworks we looked at, we didn&#x27;t have to say much about
their use of JavaScript.  JavaScript is an obvious choice, in 2023 at
least: it is ubiquitous, has high quality implementations, and as a
language it is quite OK and progressively getting better.  Up to now…</span>

We&#x27;re only a few articles in to this series on mobile application development frameworks, but I feel like we are already well into our journey.  We started our trip through the design space with a look at 
,
which defines its user interface in terms of the web platform, and only
calls out to iOS or Android native features as needed.  We proceeded
on to ,
which moves closer to native by rendering to platform-provided UI
widgets, layering a cross-platform development interface on top.Ionic /

Today&#x27;s article takes an in-depth look at , whose point in the design space is further on the road towards

and mobile application development.
Yesterday we looked into , giving a brief
structural overview of what Capacitor apps look like under the hood and
how this translates to three aspects of performance: startup latency, jank,
and peak performance.  Today we&#x27;ll apply that same approach to another
popular development framework, .Ionic / CapacitorReact Native
I don&#x27;t know about you, but I find that there is so much marketing smoke
and lights around the whole phenomenon that is React and React Native
that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to see what&#x27;s actually there.  This is
compounded by the fact that the programming paradigm espoused by React
(and its &quot;native&quot; cousin that we are looking at here) is so effective at
enabling JavaScript …</span>

internals.  A client at work recently asked me to look into
cross-platform mobile application development and is happy for the
results to be shared publically.  This, then, is the first in a series

The angle I am taking is, if you were designing a new mobile operating
system that uses JavaScript as its native application development
language, what would it mean to adopt one of these as your primary app
development toolkit?  It&#x27;s a broad question but I hope we can come up
with some useful conclusions.

When working with the Julia language, one visualization I enjoy is seeing the type space of a method that you are dispatching on. Normally I do this in my mind&#x27;s eye, but let me clarify this by drawing some actual figures.
To start with the basics; Julia has functions and methods. A function is simply the name, like push! or read . Methods are specific definitions of a function, for certain types of arguments. Take for example push!(s::Set, x) or read(io::IO) . From an object-oriented perspective you could say that methods are instances of functions.

For any given method you can consider the dispatching as slicing a part of the entire possible type space of that gi…</span>

                              <span>In 2018, I wrote a blog post and the Cookbook page on how to build Common Lisp binaries, and how to parse command-line arguments with the unix-opts library.
But since then, new libraries were created an they are pretty good! They are simpler to use, and have much more features. I had a good experience with Clingon: its usage is clear, its documentation is very good, it is very flexible (it has hooks and generic functions waiting to have an :around method) and @dnaeon is not at his first great CL project.
You might give adopt a look, or maybe defmain though I felt a little something was missing.
So I updated the guide to use Clingon. Let’s go.

See, I have too many projects right now.
In and of itself this is not so much of a problem as a condition. I know
my limits; I keep myself from burning out by shedding load, and there is
a kind of priority list of which projects keep adequate service levels.

From Research to Engineering
I am a scientist who danced with startups and moved into industry. I&#x27;ve spend years doing research, and years doing software product development. During those years I have gotten slightly frustrated with the process of moving ideas from research to production, primarily in my favorite field of scientific computing.
The typical problem is that the time from research to production can be long, often spanning multiple years per project, and the process can be error prone. Some common smaller issues I see arising in many of our projects:

                              <span>There is what I think is a confusion as to bound declarations in the Common Lisp standard. I may be wrong about this, but I think I’m correct.
Bound and free declarations
Declarations in Common Lisp can be either bound or free:
a bound declaration appears at the head of a binding form and applies to a variable or function binding made by that form;
a free declaration is any declaration which is not bound.


There are declarations which do not apply to bindings, such as optimize: these are always free.
Examples of bound and free declarations
In the form
(let ((x 1))
  (declare (type integer x))
  ...)
the declaration is bound and applies to the binding of x. In the form
(let ((/x/ 1))
  (declare (special /x/)
           (optimize (speed 3)))
  ...)
the special declaration is bound and appli…</span>

Janet macros are Common Lisp-flavored unhygienic gensym-style macros. They are extremely powerful, and very easy to write, but they can be pretty tricky to get right. It’s easy to make mistakes that lead to unwanted variable capture, or to write macros that only work if they’re expanded in particular contexts, and it can be pretty difficult to detect these problems ahead of time.
So people have spent a lot of time thinking about ways to write macros more safely – sometimes at the cost of expressiveness or simplicity – and almost all recent languages use some sort of hygienic macro system that defaults to doing the right thing.
But as far as I know, no one has approached macro systems f…</span>

A solid way to help people is to reflect on the last years and think about what would have helped your past self. In my case, I have been busy trying to develop and deploy numerical computing applications with the Julia language. One thing that I found lacking was good material on how to do numerical computing professionally in the industry, something I learned is sometimes called &quot;scientific software engineering&quot;. A book or blog about large-scale development and deployment into production systems would have helped me tremendously. I had to learn most things the hard way through trial and error.
Since what I need doesn&#x27;t exist, we will have to make it exist! That&#x27;s this blog!

(print &quot;hey janet&quot;)

I like Janet so much that I wrote an entire book about it, and put it on The Internet for free, in the hopes of attracting more Janetors to the language.
I think you should read it, but I know that you don’t believe me, so I’m going to try to convince you. Here’s my attempt at a sales pitch: here is why you – you of all people – should give Janet a chance.

                              <span>I wrote a book.
It’s called Janet for Mortals, and it’s free, and it’s on the internet, and you can read it right now.
And you should read it right now, instead of reading this blog post, because this blog post is not very interesting if you haven’t read the book. Heck, this blog post is not very interesting even if you have read the book. This blog post is a thinly-veiled promotion for my book to slip into my newsletter and RSS feed, with just enough additional content to pad it out to the length of a real post.
The book is about Janet, a programming language that I have written about before. I’ve been using Janet a lot lately, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it, and I think that more people should know about it so that they can have fun with it too. People like you.

                              <span>Another month gone by. There&#x27;s no major updates this month, since we just had the level editor release last month. However, there is a somewhat major update coming out next week!
You may have guessed from the title, but we&#x27;re adding Japanese localisation to the game! It&#x27;ll release on Wednesday, 12th of April. As someone that&#x27;s been trying to learn Japanese for a long time, this is another step in the development that I&#x27;ve been looking forward to very much.

I&#x27;m also really glad that we can release this already, so it&#x27;ll be well out by the time I visit Tokyo Game Show in September!
Other news
With the level editor and the beginning of the modding support already in place, I&#x27;ve taken a bit of a step back from Kandria development for a bit, and instead focused on working on a lot of other stuff that&#x27;s been way overdue, like moving and upgrading our servers, taking care of my mental health, and starting work on pre-pre-production for the next game.
However, Kandria development is not yet done. The second and final major update with an official modding API is still coming. I don&#x27;t have a release date for that yet, so I hope you remain patient!
In the meantime, my paper for the European Lisp Symposium in Amsterdam was accepted, so I will be presenting Kandria there. The paper is quite technical, but if you&#x27;re interested in Common Lisp, it might be worth a read. And if you&#x27;re going to be in Amsterdam, let me know. I&#x27;d be happy to chat!
That&#x27;s it for now
A rather short update this month, but if you&#x27;re interested in the details of the pre-pre-production process, come on hang out in the Shirakumo channel with the rest of us! We&#x27;re discussing all the improvements to Trial there.</span>

                              <span>In a previous article my friend Zyni wrote some variations on a list-flattening function, some of which were ‘recursive’ and some of which ‘iterative’, managing the stack explicitly. We thought it would be interesting to see what the performance differences were, both for this function and a more useful variant which searches a tree rather than flattening it.
What we measured
The code we used is here1. We measured four variations of each of two functions.
List flattening
All these functions use collecting to build their results forwards. They live in flatten-variants.lisp.
flatten/implicit-stack works in the obvious recursive way, with an implicit stack. This uses iterate to express the local recursive function.
flatten/explicit-stack uses an explicit stack (called agenda in the code) repr…</span>

                              <span>Very often people regard the stack as a scarce, expensive resource, while the heap is plentiful and very cheap. This is absurd: the stack is memory, the heap is also memory. Deforming programs so they are ‘iterative’ in order that they do not run out of the stack we imagine to be so costly is ridiculous: if you have a program which is inherently recursive, let it be recursive.
In a previous article my friend Zyni wrote some variations on a list-flattening function1, some of which were ‘recursive’ and some of which ‘iterative’. Of course, the ones which claim to be iterative are, in fact, recursive: any procedure which traverses a recursively-defined data structure such as a tree of conses is necessarily recursive. The ‘iterative’ versions just use an explicitly-maintained stack rather than…</span>

Today I&#x27;d like to share the good news that WebAssembly is finally coming
for the rest of us weirdos.
This is a transcript-alike of a talk that I gave last week at , a gathering in Berlin of
people that are using &quot;technologies beyond the mainstream&quot; to get things
done: Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, and so on.  PDF slides , and I&#x27;ll link the video too when it becomes available.BOB

WebAssembly: what even is it?  Not a programming language that
you would write software in, but rather a compilation target: a sort of
assembly language, if you will.
If you look at what the characteristics of WebAssembly are as an
abstract machine, to me there are two main areas in which it is an
advance over the alternatives.
Firstly it&#x27;s &quot;close to the metal&quot; -- if you compile for example…</span>

                              <span>A good line counting program has two features: it only counts non-empty lines
to get a fair estimate of the size of a project, and it groups line counts by
file type to help see immediately which languages are used.
A long time ago I got frustrated with two well known line counters.
Sloccount spits out multiple strange Perl
warnings about locales, and most of the output is a copyright notice and some
absurd cost estimations. Cloc has fourteen
Perl packages as dependencies. Writing a simple line counter is an interesting
exercise; at the time I was discovering Common Lisp, so I wrote my own
version.
I made a few changes years after years, but most of the code stayed the same.
I thought it would be interesting to revisit this program and present it part
by part as a demonstration of how you …</span>

First of all we all know that CL does not promise to optimize tail recursion: means that tail recursive program may generate recursive not iterative process. So recursive program in CL even if tail recursive is not safe on data of unknown size, assuming stack is limited.
But let us assume as good implementations do that tail recursion is optimized in implementation (no need for general tail calls here but is obvious nice th…</span>

next couple months and wanted to release it into the wild.  They say if
you love your ideas, you should let them go and see if they come back to
you, right?  In that spirit I abandon this idea to the woods.
Basically the idea is , but for modules
that store their data on the GC-managed heap instead of just in linear

It might look like this:GC

You define some struct and array types, there are some global variables,

Level Editor
The level editor received a big overhaul and is now a lot more accessible. There&#x27;s also official documentation now to help get you started and explain all the tools and shortcuts available. If you want to dig in, just update your game and navigate to Mod Manager &gt; Create Mod, which should place you directly into the editor in a new world of your own!
Sharing Mods
You can play levels made by others and download them directly from within the game. To browse existing levels, simply go to Mod Manager &gt; Discover. From there you can select and install mods. Once installed, you can play their world under the Worlds tab.

Level Editing
The biggest part of the update is, no doubt, the polished level editor. The editor has always been a part of Kandria since release, but now it&#x27;s nicely polished and much easier to use!

I&#x27;ve also included documentation to make it much easier for you to get a handle on how the editor works and how to get started with using it. I&#x27;m very excited to see what people can come up with!
And yes, the entire Kandria world was created in this editor, so it is fully capable of creating some very complex levels!

                              <span>Conversations with ChatGPT, a recently released chatbot, reportedly cost its inventors at OpenAI a few cents each. By Internet standards this is shockingly expensive. Though it’s touted as the future of the search engine, any company scaling the technology up to the world’s 10 billion or so daily queries will face suffocating costs. The milestone for Artificial Intelligence may be that it’s now about as expensive as the real thing: Amazon’s mechanical turk service (which Jeff Bezos called “artificial artificial intelligence”) also pays its human labourers a few cents per question-response task.</span>

                              <span>Friends, you might have noted, but over the last year or so I really
caught the GC bug.  Today&#x27;s post sums up that year, in the form of a
talk I gave yesterday at FOSDEM.  It&#x27;s long!  If you prefer video, you
can have a look instead to the .at the FOSDEM event
page
So the context for the whole effort is that Guile has this part of its
implementation which is in C.  It also exposes a lot of that
implementation to users as an API.
So what contraints does this kind of API impose on the garbage
collector?
Let&#x27;s start by considering the simple  call above.  In a
garbage-collected environment, the GC is responsible for reclaiming
unused memory.  How does the GC know that the result of a 
call is in use?consscm_cons

Kandria Launch
Well, in case you missed the launch, the game is now officially available on Steam, Itch, and directly on our Website.
The reviews we&#x27;ve gotten have been very positive, both from press, on Steam, and on the streams I&#x27;ve caught! I&#x27;m really happy that people have been enjoying the game, and am very thankful for all of the support and well wishes.
The first two weeks after launch were spent furiously fixing things, with a patch being released almost every day. Things have calmed down a lot since, and while there&#x27;s a few polish things left over that we know about, overall the game is now very stable, and even got the official Steam Deck Verified rating!
But, the work isn&#x27;t done yet.

                              <span>How much memory should a program get?  Tonight, a quick note on sizing
for garbage-collected heaps.  There are a few possible answers,
depending on what your goals are for the system.
Sometimes you build a system and you want to study it: to identify its
principal components and see how they work together, or to isolate the
effect of altering a single component.  In that case, what you want is a
fixed heap size.  You run your program a few times and determine a heap
size that is sufficient for your problem, and then in future run the
program with that new fixed heap size.  This allows you to concentrate
on the other components of the system.
A good approach to choosing the fixed heap size for a program is to
determine the minimum heap size a program can have by bisection, then
multiplying …</span>

I recommend buying it on Steam, as the algorithm there will help us bring the game in front of more people, as well. However, if that isn&#x27;t a possibility for you, there&#x27;s also options on Itch.io and through Xsolla on our webpage:

I am also live on Steam, Twitch, and YouTube right now, to celebrate the launch! Come on and hang out in the chat: https://stream.shinmera.com
I hope you all enjoy the game, and thank you very much for sticking with us for all this time!</span>

Small AI for More Personal Enjoyment
Over the last few years, I’ve spent time learning, exploring, and contributing to open source deep learning. It continues to amaze me with its rapid movement and achievements at scale. However, the scale is really too big and too slow for me to enjoy it anymore.
Between work and family, I don’t have a lot of free time. When I do get a few precious hours to do some coding just for me, I want it it to be small enough for me to fire up and play with it in a REPL on my local laptop and get a result back in under two minutes.

Or should I say, woah! Well, let&#x27;s take a moment and look at some of all of the things that happened, before we look at what the future may possibly hold in store for us. At least, if I have anything to say about it.
Honestly, so many things happened that I barely remember most of them. I had to go back through the monthly reviews to remember all of it. But then again, I&#x27;ve always been rather terrible at remembering things that far back in any chronologically complete manner. I won&#x27;t be going over stuff in chronological order, either, but instead will touch on a bunch of individual topics. Let&#x27;s start out with

That being said, today I was reminded how easy it is to cover the basics with the command-line. If we want a list of the top 10 contributors (in terms of commits) we can get it like this:1 All examples use CIDER’s repository. ↩</span>

                              <span>Today someone asked in OCaml’s Discord “How do you call a variable that refers to a filename without its extension?”. I always thought there was no specific term for this and I always named such variables filename-sans-extension (or similar), but it turns out I was wrong. It’s never too late to learning something new! But first a bit of (subjective) terminology:</span>

Various Things
The translation is going slow, as I&#x27;m doing it myself and am not used to a good workflow for that. I expect I&#x27;ll get the hang of it yet though and I&#x27;ve already made pretty significant progress on it.
Other than that, the achievement icons are done, thanks to Blob! I&#x27;m really happy with how they turned out, and it&#x27;s nice to have some of his high-res art associated with the game.
Finally, I took two days to develop a new webservice for key distribution, which will allow you to buy the game DRM-free directly on our website once it releases. This…</span>

Abstract: Many probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) attempt to integrate with equation solvers (differential equations, nonlinear equations, partial differential equations, etc.) from the inside, i.e. the developers of the PPLs like Stan provide differential equation solver choices as part of the suite. However, as equation solvers are an entire discipline to themselves with many active development communities and subfields, this places an immense burden on PPL developers to keep up with the changing landscape of tens of thousands of independent researchers. In this talk we will explore how Julia PPLs such as Turing.jl support of equation solvers from the outside, i.e. how the tools of differentiable programming allows equation solver libraries to be compatible with PPLs  ...

                              <span>Physically, this book is obnoxious: huge, wasted margins frame a reproduction
of the original text that painstakingly tries to look as shabby as it was,
including faded letters and all its typos, and its size and weight border on
the unmanageable.  Ah, but the contents is really good: on the one hand
there&#x27;s of course Joyce&#x27;s text itself (after twenty years since the last time,
my English, with the help of the annotations, was closer to be up to the task,
and enjoy it even when it wasn&#x27;t), and next to it the essays introducing every
chapter, which i found (with an exception or two) very informative and,
sometimes, even illuminating.  I was also delighted to confirm that the
parallels with Homer&#x27;s work are a strecht to say the least: i quickly read The
Odyssey in preparation and found it, again, boring at best and disheartening
in its depiction of the society of the time (not that Joyce&#x27;s Dublin was
without its blemishes, but you hopefully get my point).



So, just get an electronic version and enjoy!

                              <span>This is a beautiful book.  Crystal-clear and insightful explanations, with the
right amount of historical background and quite original outlook (without
going overboard).  I can only echo what other quoted reviewers have said: i
wish i had had this book when i was studying these matters in earnest, i&#x27;m
pretty sure i&#x27;ve understood some fine points for the first time only now!  I&#x27;d
also perhaps make an exception on the last part (or act, as Needham calls
them) on differential forms, which feels at times a bit rushed and in need of
some editing, and it&#x27;d had been wonderful if the manufacture of the book were
up to its contents: most images and photographs look really, really cheap, and
there are more typos than granted, which is a pity (as to other figures,
they&#x27;re decent, although it must be said that Needham is not Penrose, but then
who is?).

                              <span>Automatic differentiation of a “solver” is a subject with many details for doing it in the most  effective form. For this reason, there are a lot of talks and courses that go into lots of depth on the topic. I recently gave a talk on some of the latest stuff in differentiable simulation with the American Statistical Association, and have some detailed notes on such adjoint derivations as part of the 18.337 Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning graduate course at MIT. And there are entire organizations like my SciML Open Source Software Organization which work day-in and day-out on the development of new differentiable solvers.
I’ll give a brief summary of all my materials here below.

We looked at this problem in detail in our new manuscript titled Capturing missing physics in climate model parameterizations using neural differential equations.
The goal of this project is to understand temperature mixing in large eddy simulations, essentially columns of water in the ocean. I.e., can we take a “true” 3D Navier-Stokes and use that to build very quick and accurate models for how heat flows up and down in the water?

This isn’t a new problem: climate scientists  ... READ MORE

                              <span>A very interesting view of how a biographer started her career in the
seventies, with two heavy-weights, Beckett and de Beauvoir.  Bair calls the
book a bio-memoir, and it&#x27;s indeed quite deserving of a name of its own for
its genre.  One learns of the struggle it was not only to be a biographer of
famous writers still living (and her fascinating relationship with them) but
also to be a successful woman in the seventies.  And there are lots of
interesting details about her writing process, and its all too human side.
Very well written all around, it really whets your appetite: i&#x27;ve already
ordered her Beckett bio!

                              <span>Lately, i&#x27;ve gravitated towards recoll as a unified search engine for all my
local data, including org and text notes, documents in PDF or similar formats,
HTML files, and local email. As a result, my little consult-recoll package has
gone up a few notches up in my list.  i&#x27;ve just released version 0.5,
featuring live previews.












Recoll is a local search engine that knows how to index a wide variety of file
formats.  It also offers a sophisticated query language, and, for some
document kinds, snippets of the text of the document that actually match your
query: that&#x27;s always been one of my favourite features, and wanted to bring it
to emacs.



i found consult&#x27;s live previews a very nice venue to bring snippets into

                              <span>Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) methods allow for the automatic discovery of mechanistic models by infusing neural network training into the simulation process. In this talk we will start by showcasing some of the ways that SciML is being used, from discovery of extrapolatory epidemic models to nonlinear mixed effects models in pharmacology. From there, we will discuss some of the increasingly advanced computational techniques behind the training process, focusing on the numerical issues involved in handling differentiation of highly stiff and chaotic systems. The viewers will leave with an understanding of how compiler techniques are being infused into the simulation stack to increasingly automate the process of developing mechanistic models

                              <span>Take a look at this:



This is a triangulation of a set of random points, such that all the points are connected to one another, all of the faces are triangles, and the edges include the convex hull of the points.
I would like to claim that this is not a very “good” triangulation. This algorithm tends to produce lots of long, slivery triangles, and a really uneven distribution of edge counts across different vertices – some vertices have way more edges than they need to.
Here’s a different triangulation. These are the exact same points, but I triangulated them smarter:

Isn’t that better? (Click to compare!)
Depending on your dice rolls you might still have a few slivers, usually around the outer perimeter, but I’m willing to bet that it’s a noticeable improvement over the first attempt.
