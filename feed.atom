        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I wrote an article describing one of the ways traditional Lisp macros can be unhygienic even when they appear to be hygienic. Here’s a horrible solution to that.
The problem I described is that the expansion of a macro can refer to the values (usually the function values) of names, which the user of the macro can bind, causing the macro to fail. So, given a function
(defun call-with-foo (thunk)
  ...
  (funcall thunk))
Then the macro layer on top of it
(defmacro with-foo (&body forms)
  `(call-with-foo (lambda () ,@forms)))
is not hygienic so long as local functions named call-with-foo are allowed:
(flet ((call-with-foo (...) ...))
  (with-foo ...))
The sensible solution to this is to say, just as the standard does about symbols in the CL package that you are not allowed to do that.
Here’s another solution:
(defmacro with-foo (&body forms)
  `(funcall (symbol-function 'call-with-foo) (lambda () ,@forms)))
This is robust against anything short of top-level redefinition of call-with-foo. And you can be mostly robust even against that:
(defmacro with-foo (&body forms)
  `(funcall (load-time-value (symbol-function 'call-with-foo))
            (lambda () ,@forms)))
This still isn’t safe against really malignant users, since the load time of the macro’s definition and its uses are not the same. But it’s probably fairly good.
I hope I never feel I have to use techniques like this.]]></summary>

With the other frameworks we looked at, we didn't have to say much about
their use of JavaScript.  JavaScript is an obvious choice, in 2023 at
least: it is ubiquitous, has high quality implementations, and as a
language it is quite OK and progressively getting better.  Up to now…]]></summary>

The Julia language originated in academia and focused heavily on helping scientists write better code, which is going great and deserves much praise! However, to onboard more software engineers and professional organizations we're going to have to invest even further into code quality and automated code quality tools and other methods such as used in the field of "quality assurance". In this article I'll explore the current state in the Julia ecosystem.

When working with the Julia language, one visualization I enjoy is seeing the type space of a method that you are dispatching on. Normally I do this in my mind's eye, but let me clarify this by drawing some actual figures.
To start with the basics; Julia has functions and methods. A function is simply the name, like push! or read . Methods are specific definitions of a function, for certain types of arguments. Take for example push!(s::Set, x) or read(io::IO) . From an object-oriented perspective you could say that methods are instances of functions.

For any given method you can consider the dispatching as slicing a part of the entire possible type space of that gi…]]></summary>

Bound and free declarations
Declarations in Common Lisp can be either bound or free:
a bound declaration appears at the head of a binding form and applies to a variable or function binding made by that form;
a free declaration is any declaration which is not bound.


There are declarations which do not apply to bindings, such as optimize: these are always free.
Examples of bound and free declarations
In the form
(let ((x 1))
  (declare (type integer x))
  ...)
the declaration is bound and applies to the binding of x. In the form
(let ((/x/ 1))
  (declare (special /x/)

Janet macros are Common Lisp-flavored unhygienic gensym-style macros. They are extremely powerful, and very easy to write, but they can be pretty tricky to get right. It’s easy to make mistakes that lead to unwanted variable capture, or to write macros that only work if they’re expanded in particular contexts, and it can be pretty difficult to detect these problems ahead of time.
So people have spent a lot of time thinking about ways to write macros more safely – sometimes at the cost of expressiveness or simplicity – and almost all recent languages use some sort of hygienic macro system that defaults to doing the right thing.

You may have guessed from the title, but we're adding Japanese localisation to the game! It'll release on Wednesday, 12th of April. As someone that's been trying to learn Japanese for a long time, this is another step in the development that I've been looking forward to very much.

I'm also really glad that we can release this already, so it'll be well out by the time I visit Tokyo Game Show in September!
Other news
With the level editor and the beginning of the modding support already in place, I've taken a bit of a step back from Kandria development for a bit, and instead focused on working on a lot of other stuff that's been way overdue, like moving and upgrading our servers, taking care of my mental health, and starting work on pre-pre-production for the next game.
However, Kandria development is not yet done. The second and final major update with an official modding API is still coming. I don't have a release date for that yet, so I hope you remain patient!
In the meantime, my paper for the European Lisp Symposium in Amsterdam was accepted, so I will be presenting Kandria there. The paper is quite technical, but if you're interested in Common Lisp, it might be worth a read. And if you're going to be in Amsterdam, let me know. I'd be happy to chat!
That's it for now
A rather short update this month, but if you're interested in the details of the pre-pre-production process, come on hang out in the Shirakumo channel with the rest of us! We're discussing all the improvements to Trial there.]]></summary>

You may have guessed from the title, but we're adding Japanese localisation to the game! It'll release on Wednesday, 12th of April. As someone that's been trying to learn Japanese for a long time, this is another step in the development that I've been looking forward to very much.

I'm also really glad that we can release this already, so it'll be well out by the time I visit Tokyo Game Show in September!
Other news
With the level editor and the beginning of the modding support already in place, I've taken a bit of a step back from Kandria development for a bit, and instead focused on working on a lot of other stuff that's been way overdue, like moving and upgrading our servers, taking care of my mental health, and starting work on pre-pre-production for the next game.
However, Kandria development is not yet done. The second and final major update with an official modding API is still coming. I don't have a release date for that yet, so I hope you remain patient!
In the meantime, my paper for the European Lisp Symposium in Amsterdam was accepted, so I will be presenting Kandria there. The paper is quite technical, but if you're interested in Common Lisp, it might be worth a read. And if you're going to be in Amsterdam, let me know. I'd be happy to chat!
That's it for now
A rather short update this month, but if you're interested in the details of the pre-pre-production process, come on hang out in the Shirakumo channel with the rest of us! We're discussing all the improvements to Trial there.]]></summary>

What we measured
The code we used is here1. We measured four variations of each of two functions.
List flattening
All these functions use collecting to build their results forwards. They live in flatten-variants.lisp.
flatten/implicit-stack works in the obvious recursive way, with an implicit stack. This uses iterate to express the local recursive function.

This is absurd: the stack is memory, the heap is also memory. Deforming programs so they are ‘iterative’ in order that they do not run out of the stack we imagine to be so costly is ridiculous: if you have a program which is inherently recursive, let it be recursive.
In a previous article my friend Zyni wrote some variations on a list-flattening function1, some of which were ‘recursive’ and some of which ‘iterative’. Of course, the ones which claim to be iterative are, in fact, recursive: any procedure which traverses a recursively-defined data structure such as a tree of conses is necessarily recursive.

WebAssembly: what even is it?  Not a programming language that
you would write software in, but rather a compilation target: a sort of
assembly language, if you will.
If you look at what the characteristics of WebAssembly are as an

Sloccount spits out multiple strange Perl

absurd cost estimations. Cloc has fourteen

exercise; at the time I was discovering Common Lisp, so I wrote my own

So what contraints does this kind of API impose on the garbage

The translation is going slow, as I'm doing it myself and am not used to a good workflow for that. I expect I'll get the hang of it yet though and I've already made pretty significant progress on it.
Other than that, the achievement icons are done, thanks to Blob! I'm really happy with how they turned out, and it's nice to have some of his high-res art associated with the game.

Abstract: Many probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) attempt to integrate with equation solvers (differential equations, nonlinear equations, partial differential equations, etc.) from the inside, i.e. the developers of the PPLs like Stan provide differential equation solver choices as part of the suite. However, as equation solvers are an entire discipline to themselves with many active development communities and subfields, this places an immense burden on PPL developers to keep up with the changing landscape of tens of thousands of independent researchers. In this talk we will explore how Julia PPLs such as Turing.jl support of equation solvers from the outside, i.e. how the tools of differentiable programming allows equation solver libraries to be compatible with PPLs  ...

of the original text that painstakingly tries to look as shabby as it was,
including faded letters and all its typos, and its size and weight border on
the unmanageable.  Ah, but the contents is really good: on the one hand
there's of course Joyce's text itself (after twenty years since the last time,
my English, with the help of the annotations, was closer to be up to the task,
and enjoy it even when it wasn't), and next to it the essays introducing every
chapter, which i found (with an exception or two) very informative and,
sometimes, even illuminating.  I was also delighted to confirm that the
parallels with Homer's work are a strecht to say the least: i quickly read The
Odyssey in preparation and found it, again, boring at best and disheartening
in its depiction of the society of the time (not that Joyce's Dublin was
without its blemishes, but you hopefully get my point).



So, just get an electronic version and enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a beautiful book.  Crystal-clear and insightful explanations, with the
right amount of historical background and quite original outlook (without
going overboard).  I can only echo what other quoted reviewers have said: i
wish i had had this book when i was studying these matters in earnest, i'm
pretty sure i've understood some fine points for the first time only now!  I'd
also perhaps make an exception on the last part (or act, as Needham calls
them) on differential forms, which feels at times a bit rushed and in need of
some editing, and it'd had been wonderful if the manufacture of the book were
up to its contents: most images and photographs look really, really cheap, and
there are more typos than granted, which is a pity (as to other figures,
they're decent, although it must be said that Needham is not Penrose, but then
who is?).

For this reason, there are a lot of talks and courses that go into lots of depth on the topic. I recently gave a talk on some of the latest stuff in differentiable simulation with the American Statistical Association, and have some detailed notes on such adjoint derivations as part of the 18.337 Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning graduate course at MIT. And there are entire organizations like my SciML Open Source Software Organization which work day-in and day-out on the development of new differentiable solvers.

seventies, with two heavy-weights, Beckett and de Beauvoir.  Bair calls the
book a bio-memoir, and it's indeed quite deserving of a name of its own for
its genre.  One learns of the struggle it was not only to be a biographer of
famous writers still living (and her fascinating relationship with them) but
also to be a successful woman in the seventies.  And there are lots of
interesting details about her writing process, and its all too human side.
Very well written all around, it really whets your appetite: i've already
ordered her Beckett bio!
