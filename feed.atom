Abstract: Many probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) attempt to integrate with equation solvers (differential equations, nonlinear equations, partial differential equations, etc.) from the inside, i.e. the developers of the PPLs like Stan provide differential equation solver choices as part of the suite. However, as equation solvers are an entire discipline to themselves with many active development communities and subfields, this places an immense burden on PPL developers to keep up with the changing landscape of tens of thousands of independent researchers. In this talk we will explore how Julia PPLs such as Turing.jl support of equation solvers from the outside, i.e. how the tools of differentiable programming allows equation solver libraries to be compatible with PPLs  ...

of the original text that painstakingly tries to look as shabby as it was,
including faded letters and all its typos, and its size and weight border on
the unmanageable.  Ah, but the contents is really good: on the one hand
there's of course Joyce's text itself (after twenty years since the last time,
my English, with the help of the annotations, was closer to be up to the task,
and enjoy it even when it wasn't), and next to it the essays introducing every
chapter, which i found (with an exception or two) very informative and,
sometimes, even illuminating.  I was also delighted to confirm that the
parallels with Homer's work are a strecht to say the least: i quickly read The
Odyssey in preparation and found it, again, boring at best and disheartening
in its depiction of the society of the time (not that Joyce's Dublin was
without its blemishes, but you hopefully get my point).



So, just get an electronic version and enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a beautiful book.  Crystal-clear and insightful explanations, with the
right amount of historical background and quite original outlook (without
going overboard).  I can only echo what other quoted reviewers have said: i
wish i had had this book when i was studying these matters in earnest, i'm
pretty sure i've understood some fine points for the first time only now!  I'd
also perhaps make an exception on the last part (or act, as Needham calls
them) on differential forms, which feels at times a bit rushed and in need of
some editing, and it'd had been wonderful if the manufacture of the book were
up to its contents: most images and photographs look really, really cheap, and
there are more typos than granted, which is a pity (as to other figures,
they're decent, although it must be said that Needham is not Penrose, but then
who is?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic differentiation of a “solver” is a subject with many details for doing it in the most  effective form. For this reason, there are a lot of talks and courses that go into lots of depth on the topic. I recently gave a talk on some of the latest stuff in differentiable simulation with the American Statistical Association, and have some detailed notes on such adjoint derivations as part of the 18.337 Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning graduate course at MIT. And there are entire organizations like my SciML Open Source Software Organization which work day-in and day-out on the development of new differentiable solvers.

seventies, with two heavy-weights, Beckett and de Beauvoir.  Bair calls the
book a bio-memoir, and it's indeed quite deserving of a name of its own for
its genre.  One learns of the struggle it was not only to be a biographer of
famous writers still living (and her fascinating relationship with them) but
also to be a successful woman in the seventies.  And there are lots of
interesting details about her writing process, and its all too human side.
Very well written all around, it really whets your appetite: i've already
ordered her Beckett bio!

From there, we will discuss some of the increasingly advanced computational techniques behind the training process, focusing on the numerical issues involved in handling differentiation of highly stiff and chaotic systems.

Abstract: As modeling has become more ubiquitous, our models keep growing. The time to build models, verify their behavior, and simulate them is increasing exponentially as we seek more precise predictions. How will our tools change to accommodate the future? Julia’s language design has led to new opportunities. The combination of multiple dispatch, staged compilation, and Julia’s composable libraries have made it possible to build a next generation symbolic-numeric framework. Julia’s abstract interpretation framework enables capabilities such as automatic differentiation, automatic surrogate generation, symbolic tracing, uncertainty propagation, and automatic  ...
