        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Follow me along this garden path (based on true events).
We have a nifty program and we want it to be flexible, so it has a
  config file.  We make up some sort of syntax that indicates
  key/value pairs.  Maybe we’re hipsters and use YAML.  Life is good.
But we find that we to configure something dynamically, say based
  on the value of an environment variable.  So we add some escape
  syntax to the config file to indicate that a value is a variable
  rather than a literal.  But sometimes the string needs a little work
  done to it, so we add some string manipulation features to the
  escape syntax.
And when we deploy the program, we find that we’ve want to
  conditionalize part of the configuration based on the deployment, so
  we add a conditional syntax to our config language.  But
  conditionals are predicated on boolean values, so we add booleans to
  our config syntax.  Or maybe we make strings do double duty.  Of
  course we need the basic boolean operators, too.
But there’s a lot of duplication across our configurations, so we
  add the ability to indirectly refer to other config files.  That
  helps to some extent, but there’s a lot of stuff that is almost
  duplicated, except for a little variation.  So we add a way to make
  a configuration template.  Templating needs variables and quoting,
  so we invent a syntax for those as well.
We’re building a computer language by accident, and without a clear
  plan it is going to go poorly.  Are there data types (aside from
  strings)?  Is there a coherent type system?  Are the variables
  lexically scoped?  Is it call-by-name or call-by-value?  Is it
  recursive?  Does it have first class (or even second class)
  procedures?  Did we get nested escaping right?  How about quoted
  nested escaping?  And good grief our config language is in YAML!
If we had some forethought, we would have realized that we were
  designing a language and we would have put the effort into making it
  a good one.  If we’re lazy, we’d just pick an existing good
  language.  Like Lisp.]]></summary>

Since the pandemic, or maybe a bit before, I picked up a new habit: if I hear of a book which is liked by someone I find interesting, I buy a copy.
Getting to this point required some mental changes.  When I was younger, buying lots of books wasn’t really thinkable; as a student I was well-served by libraries in my mother tongue, and never picked up the habit of allocating my meager disposable income to books.  I did like bookstores, especially used bookstores, but since leaving university I emigrated to countries that spoke different languages; the crate-digging avenue was less accessible to me.
I also had to make peace with capitalism, or as the comic says it, “participating in society”.  We all know that Amazon imposes a dialectic…]]></summary>

The website is live: https://juliacon.org/local/eindhoven2023/. You can submit proposals, book early-bird tickets and consider joining as a volunteer.
We named it "JuliaCon Local" to avoid any confusion with the yearly Global JuliaCon, which is typically also associated with a city name. The date is also positioned in the winter, to be out of sync with the summer schedule of the Global JuliaCon conferences. People who could not attend the Global JuliaCon now have another opportunity to meet like-minded Julians and computational scientists in the industry and academia.
My apologies if I notify you via multiple channels, including my blog, but we are really excited about growing our scientific computing community in the area. Please consider sharing the news with your network. Of course everyone on the planet is welcome to join our conference! Hopefully we are paving the path to more city-level JuliaCon conferences.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Write a polemic about how omitting conditional expressions from a
  language is lazy and stupid.
Conditional expressions are a fundamental feature of any
  programming language that claims to be expressive, concise and
  elegant. They allow programmers to write complex logic in a single
  line, without the need for verbose and repetitive if-else
  statements. They also enable functional programming paradigms, such
  as pattern matching and recursion, that are essential for solving
  many problems efficiently and elegantly.
 

Omitting conditional expressions from a language is a sign
  of laziness and stupidity on the part of the language designers. It
  shows that they do not care about the needs and preferences of their
  users, who have to write more code, introduce more bugs, and suffer
  more frustration. It also shows that they do not understand the
  principles and benefits of functional programming, which have been
  proven by decades of research and practice. They are stuck in an
  imperative mindset, where everything has to be done with side
  effects and mutations.
 

A language without conditional expressions is a crippled
  language, that forces programmers to use hacks and workarounds to
  achieve what should be simple and natural. It is a language that
  discourages creativity, elegance and readability. It is a language
  that should be avoided by anyone who values their time, sanity and
  reputation.
Some examples of programming languages that don't have conditional expressions are:
  
CoffeeScript
Go
MATLAB
Pascal
Rust

This isn't bad, but I wanted more vitriol.  I asked and I got a
  screed that could have come out of comp.lang.functional
  Unfortunately, it thought better of it and erased its own output
  before I could snapshot it.]]></summary>

We’ve seen in previous posts how we can encode data structures using Vector Symbolic Architectures in Clojure. This is an exploration of how we can use this to develop a cipher to transmit a secret message between two parties.
A Hyperdimensional Cipher
Usually, we would develop a dictionary/ cleanup memory of randomly chosen hyperdimensional vectors to represent each symbol. We could do this, but then sharing the dictionary as our key to be able to decode messages would be big. Instead, we could share a single hyperdimensional vector and then use the protect/ rotation operator to create a dictionary of the alphabet and some numbers to order the letters. Think of this as the initial seed symbol and the rest being defined as n+1.

Design patterns are not something beginner programmers typically think about a lot (that includes most scientists), they are probably focused on making their code work.

At the other extreme such patterns can become a religion for people, where everything has to be a design pattern, or else the code is not considered good enough. However, people who make this mistake are not senior programmers either in my opinion. Senior programmers look for a balance between pure abstraction and simplicity (and many other requirements).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the threshold of the Northern Hemisphere's Midsummer's Eve, we unveil the second revision of the Tenth Edition of the Armed Bear Common Lisp implementation, viz. abcl-1.9.2.


Most notably, we are pleased to present the fruits of Alejandro Zamora Fonseca's labors on an interpreted implementation of CL:STEP with the first release of the ABCL-STEPPER contrib.  See <https://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.9.2/contrib/abcl-stepper/README.markdown> for more details.  This implementation was the subject of his demonstration <https://zenodo.org/record/7815887> as this year's European Lisp Symposium.


The POSIX-SYSCALLS contrib now provides the ability to set environment variables under UNIX systems <https://abcl.org/trac/changeset/15700>, as well as providing an example of how best to add abstract additional functionality to the core implementation.


This release also features a substantially re-worked Gray Stream implementation which fixes enough our implementation to be a first class citizen of SLIME's usage.  With the next release of SLIME, one will have to use abcl-1.9.2 in order to use the slime-repl.  See <https://github.com/slime/slime/pull/765> for more details.


The ASDF-JAR contrib has been restored to a usable functionality, which includes re-packaging of ASDF systems from within jar files as well as better abstraction for finding non-source artifacts.  Please refer to <https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/abcl/abcl/-/blob/master/contrib/asdf-jar/README.markdown> for a refresher on what facilities ASDF-JAR provides for the aspiring ASDF packager.


A complete list of changes may be viewed at <https://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.9.2/CHANGES>.


The release itself is available at <https://abcl.org/releases/1.9.2/>.


Thanks to everyone who continue to support the Bear.  Enjoy yer evening...]]></summary>

The “Main” Plotting Packages
Here’s a quick summary of the most widely used plotting packages. I may have missed one, but I haven’t missed one that is very widely used.
Plots.jl is the most used. It’s probably the most documented, used in the most tutorials, and is used in many videos.

Pros: Its main draw is that it has a lot of plugins to other packages through its recipes system, which means that a lot of odd things like `plot(sol::ODESolution)` or showing the sparsity of a `BandedMatrix` just works. With all of these integrations, it’s normally what I would recommend first to newcomers since they will generally get the most done with the least work. It  ... READ MORE

Taking a step back, with the exception of Ark which has a special
relationship to HarmonyOS and Huawei, these frameworks are all layers on
top of what is provided by Android or iOS.  Why would you do that?
Presumably there are benefits to these interstitial layers; what are
they?
Probably the most basic answer is that an app framework layer offers the
promise of abstracting over the different platforms.  This way you can
just have one mobile application development team instead of two or
more.  In practice you still need to test on iOS and Android at least,
but this is cheaper than having fully separate Android and iOS teams.

browser to make documentation generation a
more interactive experience. A great thing about Lisp development is
changing a single function and quickly seeing how it behaves without

turned out. The live documentation browser does away with this step,
which tightens the edit/document loop.
PAX also got an apropos browser. It could always
generate documentation for stuff not written with PAX in mind, so
with the live browser already implemented, this was a just a small
add-on.
The trouble with interactivity is, of course, that it's difficult to
get the point across in text, so I made two short videos that

For microcontroller projects, uLisp is a great option.  It provides a Lisp REPL on top of the Arduino libraries.  It implements a subset of Common Lisp and adds microprocessor-specific functions.
I previously built  and blogged about a handheld computer designed by uLisp’s creator.  I also ported uLisp to the SMART Response XE.
uLisp is controlled by a serial port.  People on the uLisp forum have posted various ways to do this, including some Emacs methods.  They required external software though, and I wanted something that would run in Emacs with no external dependencies.  Emacs has make-serial-process and serial-term built-in, so I wondered if I could make a REPL using those.  The result is ulisp-repl which I published to GNU ELPA.  Here is an asciinema screencast of installing and using it.  You can pause the video and copy text out of it to try in your Emacs session.
This inline player uses only free and open source JavaScript.  Or you can download ulisp-repl-1.cast and play it with the asciinema command line player.
It has syntax highlighting on the current line.  It might be cool to also implement a SLIME server in Emacs itself (and have SLIME connect to the current Emacs process instead of an external one) but uLisp programs are usually small, so it’s easy enough to copy-n-paste Lisp snippets into the REPL.]]></summary>

These organizations are dedicated to promoting better scientific software, which aligns with the mission of my blog. I wanted to know what's going on, so let's have a look at what's out there.
I noticed the names of the fields of "scientific software" vary a little, but I consider all of these roughly equivalent:
Scientific Software
Research Software Engineering (RSE)
Scientific Computing
Numerical Computing
Yes, there are differences between them, but all of them involve turning scientific knowledge into algorithms and software, and writing software to do scientific research or …]]></summary>

To start with the basics; Julia has functions and methods. A function is simply the name, like push! or read . Methods are specific definitions of a function, for certain types of arguments. Take for example push!(s::Set, x) or read(io::IO) . From an object-oriented perspective you could say that methods are instances of functions.

During those years I have gotten slightly frustrated with the process of moving ideas from research to production, primarily in my favorite field of scientific computing.
The typical problem is that the time from research to production can be long, often spanning multiple years per project, and the process can be error prone. Some common smaller issues I see arising in many of our projects:
Unreproducible, unexplainable scripts or notebooks in research

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been writing a lot of Janet lately, and I’ve been especially enjoying my time with the macro system.
Janet macros are Common Lisp-flavored unhygienic gensym-style macros. They are extremely powerful, and very easy to write, but they can be pretty tricky to get right. It’s easy to make mistakes that lead to unwanted variable capture, or to write macros that only work if they’re expanded in particular contexts, and it can be pretty difficult to detect these problems ahead of time.
So people have spent a lot of time thinking about ways to write macros more safely – sometimes at the cost of expressiveness or simplicity – and almost all recent languages use some sort of hygienic macro system that defaults to doing the right thing.
But as far as I know, no one has approached macro systems f…]]></summary>

A solid way to help people is to reflect on the last years and think about what would have helped your past self. In my case, I have been busy trying to develop and deploy numerical computing applications with the Julia language. One thing that I found lacking was good material on how to do numerical computing professionally in the industry, something I learned is sometimes called "scientific software engineering". A book or blog about large-scale development and deployment into production systems would have helped me tremendously. I had to learn most things the hard way through trial and error.

I like Janet so much that I wrote an entire book about it, and put it on The Internet for free, in the hopes of attracting more Janetors to the language.
I think you should read it, but I know that you don’t believe me, so I’m going to try to convince you. Here’s my attempt at a sales pitch: here is why you – you of all people – should give Janet a chance.

The book is about Janet, a programming language that I have written about before. I’ve been using Janet a lot lately, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it, and I think that more people should know about it so that they can have fun with it too. People like you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another month gone by. There's no major updates this month, since we just had the level editor release last month. However, there is a somewhat major update coming out next week!
You may have guessed from the title, but we're adding Japanese localisation to the game! It'll release on Wednesday, 12th of April. As someone that's been trying to learn Japanese for a long time, this is another step in the development that I've been looking forward to very much.

I'm also really glad that we can release this already, so it'll be well out by the time I visit Tokyo Game Show in September!
Other news
With the level editor and the beginning of the modding support already in place, I've taken a bit of a step back from Kandria development for a bit, and instead focused on working on a lot of other stuff that's been way overdue, like moving and upgrading our servers, taking care of my mental health, and starting work on pre-pre-production for the next game.
However, Kandria development is not yet done. The second and final major update with an official modding API is still coming. I don't have a release date for that yet, so I hope you remain patient!
In the meantime, my paper for the European Lisp Symposium in Amsterdam was accepted, so I will be presenting Kandria there. The paper is quite technical, but if you're interested in Common Lisp, it might be worth a read. And if you're going to be in Amsterdam, let me know. I'd be happy to chat!
That's it for now
A rather short update this month, but if you're interested in the details of the pre-pre-production process, come on hang out in the Shirakumo channel with the rest of us! We're discussing all the improvements to Trial there.]]></summary>

WebAssembly: what even is it?  Not a programming language that
you would write software in, but rather a compilation target: a sort of
assembly language, if you will.
If you look at what the characteristics of WebAssembly are as an
abstract machine, to me there are two main areas in which it is an
advance over the alternatives.

Sharing Mods
You can play levels made by others and download them directly from within the game. To browse existing levels, simply go to Mod Manager > Discover. From there you can select and install mods. Once installed, you can play their world under the Worlds tab.

The biggest part of the update is, no doubt, the polished level editor. The editor has always been a part of Kandria since release, but now it's nicely polished and much easier to use!

I've also included documentation to make it much easier for you to get a handle on how the editor works and how to get started with using it. I'm very excited to see what people can come up with!

Before diving into the details of what Vector Symbolic Architectures are and what it means to implement Clojure data structures in them, I’d like to start with some of my motivation in this space.
Small AI for More Personal Enjoyment
Over the last few years, I’ve spent time learning, exploring, and contributing to open source deep learning. It continues to amaze me with its rapid movement and achievements at scale. However, the scale is really too big and too slow for me to enjoy it anymore.
Between work and family, I don’t have a lot of free time. When I do get a few precious hours to do some coding just for me, I want it it to be small enough for me to fire up and play with it in a REPL on my local laptop and get a result back in under two minutes.

That being said, today I was reminded how easy it is to cover the basics with the command-line.

Abstract: Many probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) attempt to integrate with equation solvers (differential equations, nonlinear equations, partial differential equations, etc.) from the inside, i.e. the developers of the PPLs like Stan provide differential equation solver choices as part of the suite. However, as equation solvers are an entire discipline to themselves with many active development communities and subfields, this places an immense burden on PPL developers to keep up with the changing landscape of tens of thousands of independent researchers. In this talk we will explore how Julia PPLs such as Turing.jl support of equation solvers from the outside, i.e. how the tools of differentiable programming allows equation solver libraries to be compatible with PPLs  ...

of the original text that painstakingly tries to look as shabby as it was,
including faded letters and all its typos, and its size and weight border on
the unmanageable.  Ah, but the contents is really good: on the one hand
there's of course Joyce's text itself (after twenty years since the last time,
my English, with the help of the annotations, was closer to be up to the task,
and enjoy it even when it wasn't), and next to it the essays introducing every
chapter, which i found (with an exception or two) very informative and,
sometimes, even illuminating.  I was also delighted to confirm that the
parallels with Homer's work are a strecht to say the least: i quickly read The
Odyssey in preparation and found it, again, boring at best and disheartening
in its depiction of the society of the time (not that Joyce's Dublin was
without its blemishes, but you hopefully get my point).



So, just get an electronic version and enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a beautiful book.  Crystal-clear and insightful explanations, with the
right amount of historical background and quite original outlook (without
going overboard).  I can only echo what other quoted reviewers have said: i
wish i had had this book when i was studying these matters in earnest, i'm
pretty sure i've understood some fine points for the first time only now!  I'd
also perhaps make an exception on the last part (or act, as Needham calls
them) on differential forms, which feels at times a bit rushed and in need of
some editing, and it'd had been wonderful if the manufacture of the book were
up to its contents: most images and photographs look really, really cheap, and
there are more typos than granted, which is a pity (as to other figures,
they're decent, although it must be said that Needham is not Penrose, but then
who is?).

For this reason, there are a lot of talks and courses that go into lots of depth on the topic. I recently gave a talk on some of the latest stuff in differentiable simulation with the American Statistical Association, and have some detailed notes on such adjoint derivations as part of the 18.337 Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning graduate course at MIT. And there are entire organizations like my SciML Open Source Software Organization which work day-in and day-out on the development of new differentiable solvers.
