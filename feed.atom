People often say the Common Lisp package system is deficient.

Somehow this is meant to be made better by using package-local nicknames for packages. And let’s not mention the unspeakable idiocy that is thinking that a package name like, say, XML is suitable for any kind of general use at all.

promotional video, but I cannot believe it's going to be near as good as this
novel. The book has too many nuances, literary tricks and wordplay and
paragraphs one has to read and reread, to be translated to a film. The latter
might be its own work of art, and that's fine. But if you're curious about the
movie, I'd definitely recommend to read this book. If you're not, I'd
definitely recommend to read this book. The writing is fresh and funny, in
typical Gray fashion, and the real themes of the book are universal and
exposed in a way that is very entertaining on the surface, but with a subtext
that gives you food for thought. I don't remember when was the last time that
I read two hundred pages of a book in a single day, time just flew, as they
say.

There are already clients of the API so we can't remove operators, and newly

break the user contract and make pre-existing software obsolete, or abandon some
improvements. There is also an option that software is written in Common Lisp,

CLIM has two protocols that have a big overlap: sheets and output records. Both

  poorly implemented Common Lisp.  There is a reason for this.

I worked on new videos this summer and I just finished editing the subtitles. I have added 17 videos (worth 1h30+ of code-driven content) about Common Lisp macros!
We cover a lot of content: quote, backquote and comma, “,@”, comparison with C macros, comparison with functions, GENSYM and variable capture, useful patterns (call-with...), compile-time computing, read-time evaluation... (full summary below)

Since the pandemic, or maybe a bit before, I picked up a new habit: if I hear of a book which is liked by someone I find interesting, I buy a copy.
Getting to this point required some mental changes.  When I was younger, buying lots of books wasn’t really thinkable; as a student I was well-served by libraries in my mother tongue, and never picked up the habit of allocating my meager disposable income to books.  I did like bookstores, especially used bookstores, but since leaving university I emigrated to countries that spoke different languages; the crate-digging avenue was less accessible to me.
I also had to make peace with capitalism, or as the comic says it, “participating in society”.  We all know that Amazon imposes a dialectic…]]></summary>

You can quickly make an object and display it.

The website is live: https://juliacon.org/local/eindhoven2023/. You can submit proposals, book early-bird tickets and consider joining as a volunteer.
We named it "JuliaCon Local" to avoid any confusion with the yearly Global JuliaCon, which is typically also associated with a city name. The date is also positioned in the winter, to be out of sync with the summer schedule of the Global JuliaCon conferences. People who could not attend the Global JuliaCon now have another opportunity to meet like-minded Julians and computational scientists in the industry and academia.
My apologies if I notify you via multiple channels, including my blog, but we are really excited about growing our scientific computing community in the area. Please consider sharing the news with your network. Of course everyone on the planet is welcome to join our conference! Hopefully we are paving the path to more city-level JuliaCon conferences.]]></summary>

Most scientists do not think much about this problem at all, but it can have a great influence on how you should develop your code.
Basically, we need to take what you developed, turn it into something which can be given to the user, so they can install and use it in their computing environment. What to provide depends entirely on the environment of the user. So you'll first need to understand that: the so called "production environment", the environment in which your "product" or service will operate.

We’ve seen in previous posts how we can encode data structures using Vector Symbolic Architectures in Clojure. This is an exploration of how we can use this to develop a cipher to transmit a secret message between two parties.
A Hyperdimensional Cipher
Usually, we would develop a dictionary/ cleanup memory of randomly chosen hyperdimensional vectors to represent each symbol. We could do this, but then sharing the dictionary as our key to be able to decode messages would be big. Instead, we could share a single hyperdimensional vector and then use the protect/ rotation operator to create a dictionary of the alphabet and some numbers to order the letters. Think of this as the initial seed symbol and the rest being defined as n+1.

At the other extreme such patterns can become a religion for people, where everything has to be a design pattern, or else the code is not considered good enough.

The “Main” Plotting Packages
Here’s a quick summary of the most widely used plotting packages. I may have missed one, but I haven’t missed one that is very widely used.
Plots.jl is the most used. It’s probably the most documented, used in the most tutorials, and is used in many videos.

Pros: Its main draw is that it has a lot of plugins to other packages through its recipes system, which means that a lot of odd things like `plot(sol::ODESolution)` or showing the sparsity of a `BandedMatrix` just works. With all of these integrations, it’s normally what I would recommend first to newcomers since they will generally get the most done with the least work. It  ... READ MORE

application development.  To recap, we looked at:
Taking a step back, with the exception of Ark which has a special
relationship to HarmonyOS and Huawei, these frameworks are all layers on
top of what is provided by Android or iOS.  Why would you do that?
Presumably there are benefits to these interstitial layers; what are
they?
Probably the most basic answer is that an app framework layer offers the
promise of abstracting over the different platforms.  This way you can
just have one mobile application development team instead of two or
more.  In practice you still need to test on iOS and Android at least,
but this is cheaper than having fully separate Android and iOS teams.
Given that we are abstracting over platforms, …]]></summary>

I've really needed some space away from Kandria for a while, too. I did still release patches in the meantime to fix some egregious problems and bring the source back up to date with the latest changes in the Trial engine.

It is one giant complaint about how scientists are terrible at writing maintainable code for themselves.

The book doesn't provide a simple answer, but one recurring topic is "testing, testing, TESTING!" So, let's talk about testing!
Why don't scientists test their code? Well, it turns out that most scientists do not have a software engineering background, yet they find themselves writing code and software for their work. Alternatively, they may collaborate heavily with software engineers, either in academia or in the industry. If …]]></summary>

Nebulosity drives rational people crazy, its worse than NP-hard. Rational people need well defined problems. Even if you can prove that the problem cannot be solved, at least the problem itself should be known. But is this always possible?
You may have a problem that you can barely describe to yourself. You may feel some shape of it, intuitively in your mind, but you cannot explain it perfectly.

novelty in relation to the familiar, and today's note is a departure: we
are going to look at , a UI toolkit based
not on JavaScript but on the  language.old-timeFlutterDart
Where to start, even?  The problem is big enough that I'll
approach it from three different angles: from the past, from the top,
and from the bottom.
With the other frameworks we looked at, we didn't have to say much about
their use of JavaScript.  JavaScript is an obvious choice, in 2023 at
least: it is ubiquitous, has high quality implementations, and as a
language it is quite OK and progressively getting better.  Up to now…]]></summary>

The Julia language originated in academia and focused heavily on helping scientists write better code, which is going great and deserves much praise! However, to onboard more software engineers and professional organizations we're going to have to invest even further into code quality and automated code quality tools and other methods such as used in the field of "quality assurance". In this article I'll explore the current state in the Julia ecosystem.
At our workplace we have investigated the following tools and practices. I'll start from generic practices and then move on to more advanced tools.

When working with the Julia language, one visualization I enjoy is seeing the type space of a method that you are dispatching on. Normally I do this in my mind's eye, but let me clarify this by drawing some actual figures.
To start with the basics; Julia has functions and methods. A function is simply the name, like push! or read . Methods are specific definitions of a function, for certain types of arguments. Take for example push!(s::Set, x) or read(io::IO) . From an object-oriented perspective you could say that methods are instances of functions.

For any given method you can consider the dispatching as slicing a part of the entire possible type space of that gi…]]></summary>

I am a scientist who danced with startups and moved into industry. I've spend years doing research, and years doing software product development. During those years I have gotten slightly frustrated with the process of moving ideas from research to production, primarily in my favorite field of scientific computing.
The typical problem is that the time from research to production can be long, often spanning multiple years per project, and the process can be error prone. Some common smaller issues I see arising in many of our projects:

Janet macros are Common Lisp-flavored unhygienic gensym-style macros. They are extremely powerful, and very easy to write, but they can be pretty tricky to get right. It’s easy to make mistakes that lead to unwanted variable capture, or to write macros that only work if they’re expanded in particular contexts, and it can be pretty difficult to detect these problems ahead of time.
So people have spent a lot of time thinking about ways to write macros more safely – sometimes at the cost of expressiveness or simplicity – and almost all recent languages use some sort of hygienic macro system that defaults to doing the right thing.

You may have guessed from the title, but we're adding Japanese localisation to the game! It'll release on Wednesday, 12th of April. As someone that's been trying to learn Japanese for a long time, this is another step in the development that I've been looking forward to very much.

I'm also really glad that we can release this already, so it'll be well out by the time I visit Tokyo Game Show in September!
Other news
With the level editor and the beginning of the modding support already in place, I've taken a bit of a step back from Kandria development for a bit, and instead focused on working on a lot of other stuff that's been way overdue, like moving and upgrading our servers, taking care of my mental health, and starting work on pre-pre-production for the next game.
However, Kandria development is not yet done. The second and final major update with an official modding API is still coming. I don't have a release date for that yet, so I hope you remain patient!
In the meantime, my paper for the European Lisp Symposium in Amsterdam was accepted, so I will be presenting Kandria there. The paper is quite technical, but if you're interested in Common Lisp, it might be worth a read. And if you're going to be in Amsterdam, let me know. I'd be happy to chat!
That's it for now
A rather short update this month, but if you're interested in the details of the pre-pre-production process, come on hang out in the Shirakumo channel with the rest of us! We're discussing all the improvements to Trial there.]]></summary>
